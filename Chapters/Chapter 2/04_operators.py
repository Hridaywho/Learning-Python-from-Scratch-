# Arithmetic operators

a = 34

b = 4 

c = a + b# Addition operator
print(c) # This will print the sum of a and b   

# Assignment operators
a = 4-2 # Assign 4-2 in 'a'
print(a) # This will print the value of a   
b = 6 
b += 3 # increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b) # This will print the value of b

b -= 3 # decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b) # This will print the value of b

b *= 2 # multiply the value of b by 2 and then assign it to b
print(b) 

b /= 2 # divide the value of b by 2 and then assign it to b
print(b)

# Comparison operators

d = 5<4 # less than operator
print(d) # This will print False

e = 5>4 # greater than operator
print(e) # This will print True

f = 5>=4 # greater than or equal to operator
print(f) # This will print True

g = 5>5 # greater than or equal to operator
print(g) # This will print False

h = 5!=5 # The '!' sign means that is not equalt to the no. ahead of the equal sign 
print(h)

i = 5==5 # The '==' sign means that is equal to the no. ahead of the equal sign``
print(i) 

# Use single '=' for assigning the value to a alphabet or a variable 
# Use '==' for checking the equality of two values

# Logical operators
j = True or False 
# The words "or" and "and" are like the same as gates in logic 
# "or " means that if one of the values is True, then the whole expression is True
print (j) # This will print True

k = True and False
# The words "or" and "and" are like the same as gates in logic  
# "and" means that both values must be True for the whole expression to be True
print (k) # This will print False

print(not(True)) # The word "not" negates the value of the expression, so it will print False
print(not(False)) # The word "not" negates the value of the expression, so it will print True
